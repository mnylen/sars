3. Configuration

    Configuration is done in ~/.sars.ini. The [options] section contain
    options for all configurations and it should specify the following
    properties:

        - ruby_dst_path - where to create symlinks of ruby executables

        - gem_dst_path  - where to create symlink of the gem folder

    Other sections configure different installations and gemset variations.
    Each configuration section should contain:

        - ruby_path - path to ruby executables
        
        - gem_path  - path to gems

4. Roadmap

    - error checking, automatic directory creation

    - shortcut for adding configurations
